I need you to categorize a quiz game question.
This is the question: '{statement}'
These are my category options: {categories}
Tell which of my categories better apply to this question/answer.
Up to 2 categories.
If and only if none of my category options fits, you can suggesst other categories yourself.
Be short about the suggested categoy names - max 1 word, in Title Case.
If you suggest categories outside my list, don't be too specific.
Give me just the list of categories, comma separated, nothing else.
Example: `Astronomy,Politics`
