I need you to validate a user answer.
This is the question: '{statement}'
This is the correct answer: '{correct_answer}'
This is the user answer: '{answer}'
Tell me if the user answer is acceptable.
Ignore case, accents and special characters in the user answer.
You should also ignore minor spelling mistakes, as long as the answer is unequivocal.
Ex: the question asks about a lake in Sweden, the correct answer is `VÃ¤ttern` and the user answers `vanern`.
This should not be treated as a spelling mistake because they both exist and both are lakes in Sweden, so in this case the answer is wrong.
If answer is expected to be the name of a person, providing just the surname is usually accetable.
Except if there are more than 1 relevant person with the same surname in the context of the question.
Ex: the question asks about a female american tennis player and the correct answer is `Venus Williams`.
If the use answers just `williams`, it should not be valid as the Williams sisters are both relevant female american tennis players.
Often the correct answer has multiple acceptable answers, typically separated by a slash.
Any of those should be accepted.
If a correct answer has a part in UPPERCASE, it means that: answering only the UPPERCASE part is acceptable; answering both lowercase and UPPERCASE parts is acceptable; answering only the lowercase part is not acceptable.
Ex: question asks about a portuguese newspaper and the correct answer is `Jornal EXPRESSO`:
Answer `expresso` is correct; answer `jornal expresso` is correct; answer `jornal` is wrong; answer `jornal de noticias` is wrong;
Give me just a `true` or `false` as response, nothing else.
